# py-django-portfolio
My personal portfolio created using Python/Django

# Foreward
This was something new as Django is a framework that has a lot of features and needs some time to properly harness it's capabilities. I only skimmed the surface with this project, and I didn't employ the best practices, nor did I use the framework at it's best, but I did learn a lot about it, and I managed to get a result that I was pleased with

# Features
- Python/Django based, in combination with PostgreSQL for the database and Gunicorn for the webserver
- Amazon S3 bucket setup for static and media file storage using django-storages and boto3
- Simple main page with a messaging form that stores sent messages in the database
- An implementation of the Django blog app for the works section, on which projects can be updated using the Django Admin panel
  - Basic questions (comments) functionality for the projects
- CKEditor Django implementation for work posts body and image which allows HTML and file uploads
